# Privacy Policy
*Last Updated: September 18, 2019*

This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and utilized by Embrace Mobile, Inc. ("Embrace," “Embrace.io,” "we," or "us"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Embrace website at https://www.embrace.io and the Embrace services ("Services").

**SPECIAL NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS**
Embrace is hosted in the United States. If you are an user accessing Embrace from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of Embrace, which is governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and Embrace's Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.

**INFORMATION EMBRACE COLLECTS THROUGH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE
App Developer Information**
Embrace collects personally identifiable information from you, such as email address, when you sign up for our service or contact us by email. We also track many of the actions you take on our site in order to improve the service. We will never share this information with anyone for any reason unless required by law.

We understand that the data you send to us is confidential and treat it as such. We will never share the data you send us with anyone unless required by law. Access will be restricted to the team members you invite, and to certain Embrace staff in order to provide support and develop the service.

We reserve the right to analyze this data from an aggregated or anonymous standpoint, and publish aggregated or anonymous studies and figures. In doing so we will never compromise the confidentiality of your data by publishing any identifying information or data.

**End User Information**
We may collect non-personally identifiable information regarding the behavior and usage patterns of users of mobile applications ("End Users") published by our customers. Use of our Services does not require collection of personally identifiable information. Our customers may request such information from End Users in order to use their mobile applications and such personally identifiable information may be included in the data sent to us. End Users should therefore review the privacy policies of the mobile applications they use to assess the security of any personally identifiable information they disclose. To the extent we do receive any personally identifiable information, we will maintain the confidentiality of such data.

**Cookies
**We use cookies to access information when you sign in, store your preferences, to keep you logged in, and to store a limited amount of behavioral data. You can configure your browser to accept or reject these cookies and we will respect this decision by not using other means to track you.

**THE WAY EMBRACE USES INFORMATION
Contact its Users**
We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major changes to embrace.io, Embrace’s Services or for customer service purposes).

**Improve Embrace or its Services
**We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous end user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of embrace.io and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing our users' preferences and trends. We use cookies, clear GIFs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit embrace.io; (b) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; and (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.


**WHEN EMBRACE DISCLOSES INFORMATION
Provide Services**
We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

However, we do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address) or your end users' information with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.

We will retain personal information we process on behalf of our customer for as long as needed to provide services to our customer. Embrace will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Legal Requests and Comply with State and Federal Laws

**In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy
**In the event that Embrace is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.

**YOUR CHOICES**
You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Embrace or the Services, in which case Embrace may not be able to provide certain services to you.

Once we receive your transmission of information, Embrace makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Embrace learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Embrace may post a notice on Embrace.io if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
