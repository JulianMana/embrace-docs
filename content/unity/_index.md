# Unity Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

Embrace's Unity SDK lets you bring the deep, introspective and native debugging power of Embrace into your Unity game or application.

We test our SDK on all Unity LTS versions. Each Unity release varies and all Unity projects are a little different, so don't hesitate to reach out to us for support during the integration process.

Get started by following our integration guide:
[**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/unity/integration">}})

You can also view our [Change Log]({{< relref "/unity/changelog" >}}).
