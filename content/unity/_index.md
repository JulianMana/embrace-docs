# Unity Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

Embrace's Unity SDK lets you bring the deep, introspective and native debugging power of Embrace into your Unity game or application.

We test our SDK on all Unity LTS versions 2019 and newer. Each Unity release varies and all Unity projects are a little different, so don't hesitate to reach out to us for support during the integration process.

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/unity/integration">}})
2. [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/unity/features">}})

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/unity/integration">}}) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/unity/features">}}) guides to learn how
to use the advanced features our SDK provides.


You can also view our [Change Log]({{< relref "/unity/changelog" >}}).
