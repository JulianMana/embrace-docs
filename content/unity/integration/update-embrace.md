# Keeping Embrace Up To Date

Since we've integrated the SDK using Unity's Package Manager, updates are delivered automatically to your project. You must still choose to import them. Depending on the stage of your project it may make sense to upgrade now, or wait until your next release cycle.

Either way, simple return to the Package Manager and refresh it. If there is a new Embrace SDK available you will see it listed under the Embrace entry. Click the download button and then import the update.

If you have more specialized versioning needs the package manager is fully scriptable, you can read more about that in Unity's documentation here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-git.html.
