# Linking Embrace with your Unity project

Embrace is distributed as a unitypackage. The easiest way to integrate Embrace is using the Unity Package Manager's git import feature:

{{< image src="/docs/images/unity-upm-import.png" alt="Image showing how to use the package manager in Unity" caption="Unity Project showing the package manager's git import feature." width="800" height="520" >}}

1. Open your Unity project and navigate to the package manager using the `Window` menu
1. Press the `+` button in the upper left corner and choose `add package from git url`
1. Enter this url: `https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-unity-upm.git`
1. The Embrace SDK will now be imported into the packages folder of your project

Now that Embrace is part of your project, learn how to add some required configuration options in the next section.
