# Build Options

## Configuration Environments

In the Settings window under the configurations tab, we have an option that allows the creation of environments. This is a nice feature if you have multiple environments that you want to gather data from. Adding an environment to the list enables you to manage your configurations in the Getting Started window based on your desired environment.

## Custom Android Configurations
{{< image src="/docs/images/custom-android-configurations.png" alt="Image showing the Custom Android Configurations" caption="The location of the Embrace Unity Editor in the Embrace package." width="942" height="682" >}}
At build time the Embrace SDK creates a config file based on the values provided in the Android sections of the Getting Started window, This file is named `embrace-config.json` and is placed in `Temp/gradleOut/launcher/src/main`. The Android config file supports many more options than those made available in the Getting Started window. Because of this, we have added a text field in the configurations tab that enables you to write your own config settings that will override the settings generated by the SDK.
