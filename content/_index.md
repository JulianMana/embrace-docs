# Embrace Documentation

## Overview

Embrace is an automated bug tracking and performance monitoring platform that involves two components:

1. A web based dashboard to view your collected data
2. A set of SDKs that integrate with mobile applications

Our mobile SDKs ship with your application and collect data while the
application is running. That collected data is then uploaded to Embraceâ€™s
servers for processing. The processed data is then made available via our
web-based dashboard.

## Platform Guides

This documentation will walk you through the decisions you need to make, and the
process of integrating Embrace into your application and organization.
