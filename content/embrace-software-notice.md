# Embrace Software Notice

_Last Updated: April 13, 2021_

This software is solely for use with Embrace's service (“**Embrace Service**”), so to use the software you must have a valid account for the Embrace Service under a separate agreement with Embrace or the [Terms of Service](https://embrace.io/docs/terms-of-service/ "Terms of Service") (“**Subscription Agreement**”). You may only use the software to support your use of the Embrace Service as permitted in the Subscription Agreement. Without a Subscription Agreement, you may not use the software.

All other use is prohibited. Embrace and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including intellectual property rights) in the software.

The Subscription Agreement will control in event of a conflict with this notice. Unless otherwise agreed by Embrace in your Subscription Agreement:

* You may not use, copy, distribute or sublicense the software, use the software on behalf of third parties, reverse engineer or decompile the software, modify or create derivative works of the software, use the software for competitive analysis or benchmarking, or remove or obscure any proprietary notices in the software.
* **The software is provided “AS IS” and Embrace disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or noninfringement.**
* **To the full extent permitted by law, Embrace will have no liability arising from or related to the software or under this notice for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any kind, even if advised of their possibility in advance, and regardless of legal theory (whether contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise).**

The software may contain third-party open source software (“**OSS**”). To the extent required by the OSS license, that license will apply to the OSS when used on a stand-alone basis. Software versions Embrace makes available under an OSS license (such as Apache 2.0) are governed by the terms of the applicable OSS license.

For avoidance of doubt, you may copy and distribute Embrace SDKs pursuant to your Subscription Agreement as set forth in the [Embrace integration documentation](https://docs.embrace.io "Embrace Documentation").
