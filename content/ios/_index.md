# iOS Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/ios/integration">}})
2. [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/ios/features">}})

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the integration guide to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.  

Once you've completed that, browse through our feature refrence guides to learn how
to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.  

You can also view our [FAQ]({{< relref "/ios/faq" >}})
And [Change Log]({{< relref "/ios/changelog" >}})
