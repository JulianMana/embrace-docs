# iOS Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/ios/integration">}})
2. [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/ios/features">}})

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/ios/integration">}}) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.  

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/ios/features">}}) guides to learn how
to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.  

You can also view our [FAQ]({{< relref "/ios/faq" >}})
and [Change Log]({{< relref "/ios/changelog" >}})
