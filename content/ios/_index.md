# iOS Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around. 

## Decisions You Need To Make

Before you dive into integrating Embrace there are a few decisions you should
make to help guide your process:

1. Are you integrating a new App or an existing application?
1. Are you replacing an existing automated debugging SDK?
1. Do you plan to use multiple automated debugging SDKs?
1. What integration path makes sense for you?  CocoaPods, Carthage or Manual?

Thinking about the above questions will help to define the path you will take
through this documentation.  

If you are starting a new application and thinking about Embrace, we recommend
you follow the CocoaPods integration path.  This path automates many of the
steps you would otherwise have to do yourself.

If you have an established application then follow the path that most closely
matches the processes you are already using to build your application.
