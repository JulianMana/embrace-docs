how your application is performing in production.

1. [**Measure Performance.**]({{< relref "/ios/features/performance-monitoring" >}}) In this section you will learn how you can use Embrace to go beyond logging and crashes and start to examine critical user flows within your application. Measure performance, completion and abandonment easily and consistently.
