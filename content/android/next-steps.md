# Next Steps

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations on completing the Android integration guide! 

If you found anything confusing or have suggestions on improving the docs,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <support@embrace.io> or on Slack.

## API Docs

To see the full list of methods that the Android Embrace SDK exposes, please see
the [Android API docs]({{< api android >}}).

## Configuration Options

The SDK has many configuration options that we have not explored as we get you onboarded. Explore the options avialable 
on the [SDK Configuration Page]({{< relref "/android/configuration-file" >}}) to see if any are of use to you in your application.

## Check Out the FAQ

See a list of frequently asked questions on the [FAQ]({{< relref "/android/faq" >}}) page. 

## Best Practices

We offer further guides in the [Best Practices]({{< relref "/best-practices" >}}) section of the docs.
Be sure to check these out, as they'll help you make decisions that will allow you to make the most of Embrace.
