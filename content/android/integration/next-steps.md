# Next Steps

## Wrapping Up

Congratulations on completing the Android integration guide! 

If you found anything confusing or have suggestions on improving the docs,
please don't hesitate to reach out to us at <support@embrace.io> or on Slack.

## Feature Reference

Embrace includes many optional advanced features that can help you figure out some of 
the most challenging issues. Learn about these features, and how to enable them, in
our [Feature Reference]({{< relref "/android/features" >}}).

## API Docs

To see the full list of methods that the Android Embrace SDK exposes, please see
the [Android API docs]({{< api android >}}).

## Configuration Options

The SDK has many configuration options that we have not explored as we get you onboarded. Explore the options avialable 
on the [SDK Configuration Page]({{< relref "/android/features/configuration-file" >}}) to see if any are of use to you in your application.

## Check Out the FAQ

See a list of frequently asked questions on the [FAQ]({{< relref "/android/faq" >}}) page. 

## Best Practices

We offer further guides in the [Best Practices]({{< relref "/best-practices" >}}) section of the docs.
Be sure to check these out, as they'll help you make decisions that will allow you to make the most of Embrace.
