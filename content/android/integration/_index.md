# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

Embrace requires the following:

* Android 4.1 (API 16) or later
* Gradle 5.1 or later
* Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin 3.1.0+
* Java 8

If you use a version older than any of those listed above, please contact us via
email at [support@embrace.io](mailto:support@embrace.io) or reach out to us on Slack.
