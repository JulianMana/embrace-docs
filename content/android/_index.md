# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around. 

## Requirements

Embrace requires the following:

* Android 4.1 (API 16) or later
* Gradle 4.4 or later
* Android Build Tools Plugin 3.+
* Java 8

If you use a version older than any of those listed above, please contact us via
email at <support@embrace.io> or reach out to us on Slack.
