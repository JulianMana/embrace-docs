## Getting Started

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/react-native/integration">}})
2. [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/react-native/features">}})

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**]({{< relref "/react-native/integration">}}) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.  

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**]({{< relref "/react-native/features">}}) guides to learn how
to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.  

and [Change Log]({{< relref "/react-native/changelog" >}})
