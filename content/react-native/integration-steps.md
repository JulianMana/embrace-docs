# Integration Steps

1. [**Login to the Embrace Dashboard.**]({{< relref "/react-native/login-embrace-dashboard" >}}) Your data is available in the dashboard. It is important that you have this open while working on the integration to monitor progress.
1. [**Adding the Embrace SDK.**]({{< relref "/react-native/add-embrace-sdk" >}}) We'll be adding the Embrace SDK to your project.
1. [**Upload Symbol Files**]({{< relref "/react-native/upload-symbol-files" >}}) Learn which files need to be uploaded to make sure stack traces are translated.
1. [**Create Your First Session.**]({{< relref "/react-native/session-reporting" >}}) You'll launch your app after you've
   initialized Embrace, and be able to see your first session in the Embrace
   Dashboard.
1. [**Collect Your First Crash Report.**]({{< relref "/react-native/crash-reporting" >}}) Generate a crash and see the report that
   gets uploaded.
1. [**Know Your Users.**]({{< relref "/react-native/identify-users" >}}) Add your own custom identifiers to users and sessions to make sure you can aggregate and find sessions correctly.
1. [**Add a Breadcrumb.**]({{< relref "/react-native/breadcrumbs" >}}) Log messages using the Embrace SDK.
1. [**Add Alerts.**]({{< relref "/react-native/log-message-api" >}}) Use Embrace's Log Events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing we will tell you if your application breaks.
1. [**Measure Performance.**]({{< relref "/react-native/performance-monitoring" >}}) In this section you'll learn how you can leverage Embrace to go beyond logs and crashes to examine critical user flows within your app. Measure performance, completion, and abandonment easily and consistently.
1. [**Tracking Components**]({{< relref "/react-native/tracking-components" >}}) Track when a component mounts and unmounts.
