# Integration Steps

1. [**Login to the Embrace Dashboard.**]({{< relref "/flutter/integration/login-embrace-dashboard" >}}) Your data is available in the dashboard. It is important that you have this open while working on the integration to monitor progress.
1. [**Adding the Embrace SDK.**]({{< relref "/flutter/integration/add-embrace-sdk" >}}) We'll be adding the Embrace SDK to your project.
1. [**Create Your First Session.**]({{< relref "/flutter/integration/session-reporting" >}}) You'll launch your app after you've
   initialized Embrace, and be able to see your first session in the Embrace
   Dashboard.
1. [**Collect Your First Crash Report.**]({{< relref "/flutter/integration/crash-reporting" >}}) Generate a crash and see the report that
   gets uploaded.
1. [**Add a Breadcrumb.**]({{< relref "/flutter/integration/breadcrumbs" >}}) Log messages using the Embrace SDK.
1. [**Add Alerts.**]({{< relref "/flutter/integration/log-message-api" >}}) Use Embrace's Log Events to power a real-time alerting system so you can rest easy knowing we will tell you if your application breaks.
