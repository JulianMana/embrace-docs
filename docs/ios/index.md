# iOS/tvOS Platform Documentation

## Getting Started

Embrace's SDK supports both the iOS and the Apple TV platform from a common codebase. All of the API you can use on iOS, is also available on Apple TV. 

This documentation is split into two sections:

1. [**Integration Guide**](/ios/integration/)
2. [**Feature Reference**](/ios/features/)

If you are just starting out with Embrace, follow the [**Integration Guide**](/ios/integration/) to learn
the key steps to successfully using our product.

Once you've completed that, browse through our [**Feature Reference**](/ios/features/) guides to learn how
to use some of the advanced features our SDK provides.

You can also view our [FAQ](/ios/faq/) and [Change Log](/ios/changelog/)
