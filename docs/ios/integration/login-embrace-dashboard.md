# Login to the Embrace Dashboard

Before you start sending data, let's get logged into the dashboard so you have a place to verify everything you are about to work on.

Open a browser and navigate to [dash.embrace.io](https://dash.embrace.io/), and create an account if you don't have one yet.

Once logged in, press the "Create Project" button or select your application if you've already done so, and you will be taken to our integration page. We'll be working from here in this documentation.

Follow the steps shown on the screen to setup your application on the Embrace Dashboard and receive your App Id.

This is the unique App Id that you need to integrate the Embrace SDK into your project.

Next, we're going to send data to Embrace so we can finally see some interesting things in the dashboard.
