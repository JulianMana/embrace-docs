# Using the Embrace 6.x SDK

The Embrace 6.x Apple SDK is designed to provide first class observability and diagnostic data collection to your mobile application. It supports multiple platforms including iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS.

Embrace's 6.x SDK is open-source and can be found on GitHub.  We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your iOS application and getting it working. 

At this time, the majority of features exist in the 6.x SDK that already existed in the 5.x SDK. See [the 5.x feature reference](./../5x/features/) for more details, and note that some method names or implementation details may differ between the two platforms.

# Prerequisites

1. [**Open and login to the Embrace Dashboard.**](/ios/5x/integration/login-embrace-dashboard) You must be registered with Embrace to use the Embrace Dashboard.
