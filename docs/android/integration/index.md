# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

Embrace has the following minimum requirements on Android:

* Android 5.0 (API 21)
* Java 1.8
* Kotlin 1.4
* Gradle 6.5.1
* AGP (Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin) 4.0.0

If you use a version older than any of those listed above, please reach out to us on Slack.
