# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

Starting with version 6.0.0, Embrace has the following minimum requirements on Android:

* Android 5.0 (API 21)
* Java 8
* Kotlin 1.4
* Gradle 6.1.1
* Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin 4.0.0

If you use a version older than any of those listed above, please contact us via email at [support@embrace.io](mailto:support@embrace.io) or reach out to us on Slack.
