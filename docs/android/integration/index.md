# Android Integration

## Getting Started

We'll be guiding you through integrating Embrace into your Android application
with a series of articles. We recommend going through them in order, although
you are free to skip around.

## Requirements

Embrace requires the following:

* Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer
* Gradle 5.1 or newer
* Android Gradle Build Tools Plugin 3.4.0+
* Java 8 (with most recent updates) or newer

If you use a version older than any of those listed above, please contact us via email at [support@embrace.io](mailto:support@embrace.io) or reach out to us on Slack.
