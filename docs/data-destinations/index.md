# Embrace Data Destinations

As part of our Metrics Forwarding package, Embrace offers a number of Data Destinations to deliver your metrics to your cross-platform observability tool of choice:

* [Grafana visualization suite integration guide](/embrace-api/grafana_integrations/)
* [Datadog integration guide](/data-destinations/data-dog-setup.md)
* [New Relic integration guide](/data-destinations/new-relic-setup.md)
* [Grafana Cloud Integration guide](/data-destinations/grafana-cloud-setup.md)

All destinations receive a set of Standard metrics in daily, hourly, and five-minutely granularities:
* crash total
* sessions total

To get started head to Settings -> Integrations in the dashboard and setup your first destination:
