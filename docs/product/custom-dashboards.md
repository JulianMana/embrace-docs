# Custom Dashboards

In addition to our pre-built dashboards for topics like Crashes, Logs, and Network Requests, each project can create Custom Dashboards.  In these dashboards, you can create new analyses.  Visualize a time series of Crash data segmented by app-version, or get a ranking of Logs filtered by a specific property.

## Table of Issues

Our Issues Widget, lets you specify how to list a table of [Issues](/product/issue-monitoring-and-work-flow) .  You can filter for certain Issue types, add filters to limit app-versions, or select just Issues [tagged to your team.](/product/tagging)
