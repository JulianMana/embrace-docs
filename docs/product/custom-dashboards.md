# Custom Dashboards

In addition to our pre-built dashboards for topics like Crashes, Logs, and Network Requests, each project can create Custom Dashboards.  In these dashboards, you can create new analyses.  Visualize a time series of Crash data segmented by app-version, or get a ranking of Logs filtered by a specific property.

## Table of Issues

Our Issues Widget, lets you specify how to list a table of [Issues](/product/issue-monitoring-and-work-flow) .  You can filter for certain Issue types, add filters to limit app-versions, or select just Issues [tagged to your team.](/product/tagging)

To get started, click on the Issues category when making a new Widget:
<img src={require('@site/static/images/issues in dashboard.png').default} alt="Issues as a Widget option" />

Adjust the columns you want to display and how to filter the Issues
<img src={require('@site/static/images/issues widget filter.png').default} alt="customize your Issues list" />

Then once you save, you'll see this table on your dashboard!  Issues are sorted by percentage of users impacted:
<img src={require('@site/static/images/issues widget dashboard.png').default} alt="final table" />
