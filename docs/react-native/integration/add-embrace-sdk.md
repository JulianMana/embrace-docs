# Adding the React Native Embrace SDK

## Add the JavaScript library

Use Yarn or NPM to install the NPM module.

```shell-session
yarn add @embrace-io/react-native
```

```shell-session
npm install @embrace-io/react-native
```

:::info
If you are using a yarn workspace, you must run the command at the react-native application folder level or modify package.json manually. Do not run this on your yarn workspace root.
:::

For iOS you will also need to install the pod:

```shell
cd ios && pod install --repo-update
```

# Adding the SDK 

## Setup Script

The JavaScript Embrace SDK ships with a setup script to modify the files in your
project to add the native dependencies. The setup scripts can be found in your
`node_modules` folder at `node_modules/@embrace-io/dist/scripts/setup`

**Run the setup script**
```shell-session
node node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native/lib/scripts/setup/installAndroid.js
```

```shell-session
node node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native/lib/scripts/setup/installIos.js
```

:::info Clean Up Embrace implementation
If you need to clean up an Embrace implementation added manually or by our scripts you can use our uninstall script
```shell-session
node node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native/lib/scripts/setup/uninstall.js
```
:::

You can use git to see the changes that the script made.

```shell-session
git diff
```

Compare the changes to the manual setup step to verify the changes were made
correctly.

## Manually

<Tabs groupId="platform" queryString="platform">
<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">

Configuration for iOS is handled in code when initializing the SDK which we will cover in the next step. If you're on
React Native version 0.60 and above you benefit from [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/dec33cb945be548a0d30c2ea073493e253239850/docs/autolinking.md#platform-ios)
to set up the native module so you're good to go! Otherwise review the section below:

### React Native Version < 0.60

Configure your `PodFile` to add Embrace. (RN Versions < 0.6)

```ruby
target 'MyApp' do
  # ...

  pod 'EmbraceIO'
  pod 'RNEmbrace', :path => '../node_modules/@embrace-io/react-native'
end
```
Then, install the pod.

```shell-session
cd ios && pod install --repo-update
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android">

Update the `build.gradle` file (usually located at `<root>/android/build.gradle`) to include the Embrace Swazzler.

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "io.embrace:embrace-swazzler:${findProject(':embrace-io_react-native').properties['emb_android_sdk']}"
  }
}
```

Then, update the app `build.gradle` file (usually located at `<root>/android/app/build.gradle`).

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'embrace-swazzler'
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  google()
}
```

:::warning Important
React Native 0.59.0 and later automatically adds the required `compileOptions` directive to the `android/app/build.gradle` file.
If you are using a version of React Native older than 0.59.0, or your project was created with a version older than 0.59.0, add the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
android {
    // ...

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    // ...
}
```

:::

Now, add the Embrace config file at `android/app/src/main/embrace-config.json`, and add your API key and token.

```json
{
  "app_id": "xxxxx",
  "api_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

:::info
Your API ID and token are available on the Embrace dashboard.
:::

:::info
Youâ€™ll need to set the following permissions so the Embrace SDK can send events and monitor connectivity.

* `android.permission.INTERNET`
* `android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There's a little more configuration we have to do to set up the uploading of symbol files.
You'll be learning about that next.
