# React Native Feature Reference

Embrace's SDK includes many advanced features that you can enable to help you understand more about
how your application is performing in production.

1. [**Moments.**](/react-native/features/moments/) In this section you will learn how you can use Embrace to go beyond logging and crashes and start to examine critical user flows within your application. Measure performance, completion and abandonment easily and consistently.
2. [**Know your users.**](/react-native/features/identify-users/) Add your own custom identifiers to users and sessions to make sure you can aggregate and find sessions correctly.
3. [**Tracking Components.**](/react-native/features/tracking-components/) Track the mounting and unmounting of React Components for your React Native application using the Embrace SDK.
4. [**Current Session ID API.**](/react-native/features/current-session-id-api.md) This API lets you know what the current Session Id is in case you need to track it separately.
