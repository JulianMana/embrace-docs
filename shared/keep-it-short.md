Moments are best used for tracking critical user flows that are generally short in nature, like:

1. Rendering a border onto an image
1. Uploading a file to your server
1. Loading a new set of TableView cells from a local database
1. Processing the checkout from your shopping cart

Longer events, such as filling out an entire form or taking a photo with the camera, are worse candidates for moments as these tasks can have a high variance from user to user.
Only measure moments that truly matter to your business, and that you would dedicate engineering resources to improving.
