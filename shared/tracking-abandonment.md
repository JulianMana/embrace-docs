Moments measure abandonment by default. 

If the moment never completes, because:

* the user exits the app before the moment ends
* the app crashes
* an unexpected code path is taken 

the timer runs out, and we record that moment as an abandonment.
Looking at these later can help you to understand user behavior and how changes you make affect it over time.
